Chrome extension to have a custom image in a conner of the browser

This is a project I used to learn about chrome extensions and how they work. I decided to use the Bongocat meme as main icon because... 
It was funny to me. This still has some bugs but the extensions works.

The way to install it is:

1) Have Google Chrome
2) Write on the top of the browser 'chrome://extensions'
3) Once you're there, activate the Developer mode on the top right of your screen.
4) Click on 'Load unpacked extension'
5) Select the folder where the extension is
6) Disable the developer mode (optional but recomended)
7) Be happy :)
